This repo contains all the files, code, designs, and materials to replicate this project. If I'm missing anything please let me know!

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/Visualize-Magnetic-Fields-With-a-Light-Painting-We/) for step-by-step instruction on how to put it all together.

## Introduction

Ever since I got my first magnet implant, I've been obsessed with magnetic fields. I wanted a way to share the fields that I sense with other people. My idea is to visualize magnetic fields through a light painting wearable. When a magnetic field is detected with a GMR sensor, a NeoPixel stick will light up to represent the field strength, and when photographed using long exposure you can visualize different strengths of the field. The way the NeoPixels lights up can be reprogrammed to create several interesting effects (blinking, colors, number of pixels lit up, etc...) to create visually interesting combinations.

In this Instructable you'll learn how to order, fabricate, program, and assemble your own light painting wearable to visualize magnetic fields. The functionality of the device is also pretty open-ended so that you can add different sensors or different types of Neopixels for more light painting possibilities!

This project is partially sponsored by [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/), who fabricated and shipped the PCB. They also 3D printed all the parts in this Instructable. I highly recommend the service, the quality/value is great!
