# Code

Included in this Instructable are three files I used to create my light paintings. One will actuate the Neopixel stick linearly with magnetic field intensity (red -> white), the second is also linear but all Neopixels will be white, and the third will blink the Neopixel stick to create a "disconnected" effect (my personal favorite).
